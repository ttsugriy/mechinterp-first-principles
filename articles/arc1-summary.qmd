## Congratulations!
You've completed Arc I: Foundations. Before moving to Arc II (Core Theory), consolidate what you've learned.

## The Big Picture

You now understand **what we're reverse-engineering**:

## Key Concepts to Remember

### From Chapter 1: Why Reverse-Engineer?
- Neural networks discover algorithms we didn't teach them
- We have all the weights but don't understand the algorithms
- Goal: Find the *how* behind the *what*

### From Chapter 2: Transformers
- Transformers are **matrix multiplication machines**
- Attention = soft dictionary lookup (Q, K, V)
- MLPs = pattern-value memories storing knowledge
- Everything is linear algebra + a few nonlinearities (softmax, GELU)

### From Chapter 3: Residual Stream
- The residual stream is a **shared workspace**
- Output = embedding + Σ(all component contributions)
- Components read from and write to the stream—they never talk directly
- The additive structure enables **decomposition** (attribution)

### From Chapter 4: Geometry
- Activations are points in high-dimensional space
- Meaning has geometric structure: king - man + woman ≈ queen
- **Linear representation hypothesis**: features are directions
- High dimensions: distances become noisy, but near-orthogonality is abundant

## The Foundation You've Built

| Concept | What It Means for Interpretability |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Matrix multiplications | We can trace computation through linear algebra |
| Residual stream | We can decompose outputs into component contributions |
| Additive structure | Attribution is tractable |
| Geometric representations | Features are directions we can find and manipulate |

## Self-Test: Can You Answer These?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## 1. Why does the additive structure of the residual stream matter for interpretability?

Because the final output is a **sum** of contributions. We can measure exactly how much each attention head and MLP contributed to any prediction. Without this additivity, decomposition wouldn't work.

## 2. What do Q, K, V represent in attention?

- **Query (Q)**: "What am I looking for?"
- **Key (K)**: "What do I contain?"
- **Value (V)**: "What information should I provide?"

Attention weight = softmax(Q · K^T / √d). The output is a weighted sum of values.

## 3. Why are features "directions" rather than "neurons"?

Because the network doesn't know which axis is which—it just learns useful activation patterns. The meaningful structure is geometric (directions, distances, projections), not tied to the arbitrary neuron basis. A "cat" feature might involve many neurons, not just one.

## Achievements Unlocked

::: {.callout-tip}
## You Can Now...
After completing Arc I, you have new abilities:

- **Read transformer code** and understand what each component does (Q, K, V, MLP, residual connections)
- **Visualize activations** as points in high-dimensional space, not just lists of numbers
- **Understand why "king - man + woman ≈ queen"** works—and why this matters for interpretation
- **Explain the residual stream** as a shared workspace that enables component decomposition
- **Appreciate the scale** of high-dimensional spaces (near-orthogonality, concentration of measure)

You've built the mental model. You understand *what* we're looking at. Arc II answers *what it represents*.
:::

## What's Next

Arc II introduces the **core theory**:

- **Chapter 5 (Features)**: What are the atoms of meaning in activation space?
- **Chapter 6 (Superposition)**: How do networks pack more features than dimensions?
- **Chapter 7 (Toy Models)**: How can we study superposition in controlled settings?
- **Chapter 8 (Circuits)**: How do features compose into algorithms?

You have the substrate. Now you'll learn what's represented in it.
